Project Red is an effort to compile some of the best factions available from the Glest community and enhance them in hopes of becoming the flagship tech of Glest Advanced Engine.  Existing units will be modified to take advantage of GAE-specific features (such as emanations), new units will be added where necessary (e.g. boats), and factions will be tested and balanced against each other.  Essentially, the idea is to create GAE's equivalent of the Megapack.
