=== Dwarf faction mod for Glest ===
   === Release: Aglarond 0.1 ===



Authors/Contributors:
--------------------

* wciow - the original author of the Dwarf faction, made the bulk of it. His last release was Gimli, after which wciow said he would publish no more new releases.
* The Glest Team - wciow said he used parts of Magitech, the original Glest techtree, on the original Dwarf faction. Currently, all sounds (except for the Dwarves theme song) come from Magitech.
* jda ( jdalinux at yahoo dot com dot br ) picked up where the Gimli release left and is commited to finishing it up (wciow had said himself the faction still needed tweaking). I'll be releasing the Aglarond milestone-releases at least up to 1.0 (final Aglarond).
* -Archmage- ( glest at mail dot com ) has contributed good and valuable work to Aglarond practically since the begining (of jda's published intentions).
* Sir Modman ( glestisgreat at gmail dot com ) contributed the Dwarf theme-music, authoring a mix of tracks by Kevin MacLeod taken from http://incompetech.com/m/c/royalty-free/index.html?genre=Soundtrack
* John.d.h (http://johndh.deviantart.com) adapted the faction for use with Project Red, adding and modifying elements to fit with the others.
