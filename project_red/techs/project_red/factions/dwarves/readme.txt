Authors/Contributors:
--------------------

* wciow - the original author of the Dwarf faction, made the bulk of it. His last release was Gimli, after which wciow said he would publish no more new releases.
* The Glest Team - wciow said he used parts of Magitech, the original Glest techtree, on the original Dwarf faction. Currently, all sounds (except for the Dwarves theme song) come from Magitech.
* jda ( jdalinux at yahoo dot com dot br ) picked up where the Gimli release left and is commited to finishing it up (wciow had said himself the faction still needed tweaking). I'll be releasing the Aglarond milestone-releases at least up to 1.0 (final Aglarond).
* -Archmage- ( glest at mail dot com ) has contributed good and valuable work to Aglarond practically since the begining (of jda's published intentions).
* Sir Modman ( glestisgreat at gmail dot com ) contributed the Dwarf theme-music, authoring a mix of tracks by Kevin MacLeod taken from http://incompetech.com/m/c/royalty-free/index.html?genre=Soundtrack
* ElimiNator did the texture on the brand new Goat model (released in Aglarond 0.1.2) and provided feedback, suggestons and tips.
* UltiFD did testing and promotion through videos and the Glest Wiki. UltiFD's Glest YouTube channel: http://www.youtube.com/UltiFD
* John.d.h (http://johndh.deviantart.com) adapted the faction for use with Project Red, adding and modifying elements to fit with the others.

Many other people have contributed in similar ways to the old Dwarves faction this current one derives from, so we thank them too.

* Borrowed material:
- The base picture used for the Goat model (not the .tga derived from it! ) came from burningwell.org (public domain): http://www.burningwell.org/gallery2/v/Animals/img_2655.jpg.html
- As stated above, parts of the Dwarves faction, notably but no only, the sounds (except the Dwaves music by Sir Modman) came from the classic Glest techtree Magitech.
